# hangmanGame

This program runs a game of Hangman, where a user can guess a word from five different categories and three different difficulties. A words.txt file is used with the program in order to obtain the words that a user can guess in the program, and additional words can be added if desired. Dictionaries are made for each category available and have three item pairs, where each pair has a key that represents a different difficulty and the values contain a list of words that fit that same difficulty and category. Another dictionary is also used in the program where the key in each item pair represents the word that the user has attempted to guess and the value in the item pair is a boolean, where True represents that the user has successfully guessed the word and False means the user failed to guess the word. Another data structure used in the program is a priority queue, which is used to display the correct alphabetical order of the letters a user has guessed for a word.
